 <p> A hundred years ago! That's this year! Every kid in school knows that story because we all have teachers we'd like to see fall into the ravine. Great Scott! (he stops his horse) Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon...and now, I may have seriously altered history. Look, Doc, what's the worst that could happen, huh? So they don't name the ravine after her. Let's just get the Delorean ready and get the hell out of here. I wish I'd never invented that infernal time machine...it's caused nothing but disaster. </p>
